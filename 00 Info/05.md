Here is a concise comparison of **Map vs WeakMap** and **Set vs WeakSet** in JavaScript:

## Map vs WeakMap

| Feature                | Map                                                                                        | WeakMap                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key types**          | Any value (objects, primitives like strings, numbers, etc.)                                | Only objects (no primitives allowed)                                                                                  |
| **References to keys** | Strong references; keys and values stay in memory as long as the Map exists                | Weak references; keys can be garbage collected if no other references exist                                           |
| **Iteration**          | Iterable; supports `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.entries()`                                    | Not iterable; no methods to list keys or entries                                                                      |
| **Size property**      | Has `.size` property                                                                       | No `.size` property                                                                                                   |
| **Use case**           | General-purpose key-value storage where you want to maintain references to keys and values | Associating data with objects without preventing their garbage collection (e.g., caching, private data for DOM nodes) |
| **Memory management**  | Can cause memory leaks if keys are not manually removed                                    | Helps avoid memory leaks by allowing garbage collection of keys                                                       |

## Set vs WeakSet

| Feature                    | Set                                                                  | WeakSet                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Element types**          | Any value (objects, primitives)                                      | Only objects (no primitives allowed)                                            |
| **References to elements** | Strong references; elements stay in memory as long as the Set exists | Weak references; elements can be garbage collected if no other references exist |
| **Iteration**              | Iterable; supports `.values()`, `.entries()`, `.forEach()`           | Not iterable; no methods to list elements                                       |
| **Size property**          | Has `.size` property                                                 | No `.size` property                                                             |
| **Use case**               | Storing unique values where you want to maintain references          | Tracking objects without preventing their garbage collection                    |

### Summary

- **Map and Set** hold strong references and allow iteration and size queries. They are suitable when you need to keep data
  reliably and inspect it.
- **WeakMap and WeakSet** hold weak references to objects only, allowing garbage collection when no other references exist.
  They do not support iteration or size queries and are useful for memory-sensitive scenarios where you want to avoid
  preventing object cleanup.

This distinction makes WeakMaps and WeakSets ideal for managing data tied to object lifecycles without causing memory leaks,
such as caching or associating metadata with DOM elements[1][2][4][6][8].
