Dynamic programming is a computer programming technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller
overlapping subproblems, solving each one only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations. Problems
suited for dynamic programming have two main properties: overlapping subproblems (subproblems recur multiple times) and
optimal substructure (optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of subproblems)[1][2][3].

Here is a simple example of dynamic programming in JavaScript to compute the nth Fibonacci number using memoization (top-down
approach):

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  if (memo[n]) return memo[n];
  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function computes Fibonacci numbers recursively, but stores intermediate results in the
`memo` object so that each Fibonacci value is only computed once, improving efficiency significantly[3][4].
