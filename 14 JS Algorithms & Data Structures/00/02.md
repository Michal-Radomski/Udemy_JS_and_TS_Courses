The **Frequency Counter Pattern** is an algorithm design technique used to efficiently count the occurrences (frequencies) of
elements within data structures such as arrays or strings. Instead of using nested loops that typically have a time
complexity of $$O(n^2)$$, this pattern uses objects or hash maps to store the count of each element, reducing the complexity
to $$O(n)$$.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Counting occurrences:** It stores elements as keys in a dictionary or object, with their counts as associated values.
- **Avoids nested loops:** By counting frequencies in one pass, it eliminates the need to repeatedly iterate through the
  data.
- **Efficient comparison:** Useful for comparing two collections by matching their frequency counts.
- **Common use cases:** Detecting anagrams, checking if one array contains squares of another, finding duplicates, and
  verifying character presence.

### How It Works:

1. Traverse the first array or string, counting each element's frequency.
2. Traverse the second, comparing the frequency counts against the first.
3. Return a result based on whether the frequency distributions fulfill the problem's criteria.

### Example Problem:

- Checking if two arrays have the same elements, with the second containing squares of the first (frequency of elements must
  match).

Using the pattern, the solution runs in linear time $$O(n)$$ instead of quadratic, making it much more scalable and
efficient[1][2][3][4][7][8].

### Summary:

The Frequency Counter Pattern is a powerful, widely applicable method for problems requiring frequency comparison between
datasets. It improves both speed and code clarity by using maps or objects to count and compare occurrences in linear time.

This pattern is essential in coding interviews and software development to optimize algorithms involving comparison of arrays
or strings[1][2][5][7].
