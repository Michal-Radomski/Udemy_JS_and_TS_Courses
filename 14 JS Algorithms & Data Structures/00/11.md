The main difference between the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Dijkstra's algorithm lies in their objectives and
problem types:

- **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):** TSP is a combinatorial optimization problem that requires finding the shortest
  possible route that visits each city (or node) exactly once and returns to the starting city. It seeks a minimum-cost
  Hamiltonian cycle covering all nodes. This problem is complex and involves searching through many possible routes to find
  the best one. It is not simply about the shortest path between two points but rather an optimal route visiting all points
  without repetition[2][4].

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** This algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem on a weighted graph. Given a
  starting node, it finds the shortest paths from that node to all other nodes in the graph, representing the minimum
  distances. It builds a shortest path tree but does not solve the TSP because it does not require visiting all nodes exactly
  once or returning to the starting point. It is used when you want the shortest path from one node to others, not the
  shortest cyclic tour covering all nodes[1][3][4][9].

In summary, TSP is about finding the optimal route visiting all nodes exactly once and returning to the start (a cycle),
which is computationally hard, while Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently finds shortest paths from a single source node to all
other nodes but does not ensure a cycle or visiting all nodes in a single route[2][6].
