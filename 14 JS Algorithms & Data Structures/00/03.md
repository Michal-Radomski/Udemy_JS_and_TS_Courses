The **Multiple Pointers Pattern** is a technique used to solve problems efficiently by maintaining two or more pointers (or
indexes) that traverse a data structure like an array, often moving inward from both ends or at different speeds. This
approach helps reduce time complexity from potentially quadratic $$O(n^2)$$ (using nested loops) to linear $$O(n)$$,
especially in sorted arrays.

### Key characteristics:

- Usually applied on sorted arrays.
- Two pointers start at different positions (e.g., start and end).
- Pointers move based on conditions until they meet or cross.
- Efficiently find pairs, sequences, or patterns without nested loops.

### Example in TypeScript: Find all pairs in a sorted array that sum to a target value

```typescript
function findPairs(numbers: number[], target: number): number[][] {
  // Sort the array first (if not already sorted)
  numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let left = 0; // Pointer at start
  let right = numbers.length - 1; // Pointer at end
  let pairs: number[][] = [];

  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

    if (sum === target) {
      pairs.push([numbers[left], numbers[right]]);
      left++; // Move both pointers after finding a pair
      right--;
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++; // Increase sum by moving left pointer right
    } else {
      right--; // Decrease sum by moving right pointer left
    }
  }

  return pairs;
}

// Example usage:
const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 2, 8, -2];
const result = findPairs(numbers, 6);
console.log(result); // Output: [[-2, 8], [1, 5]]
```

This example illustrates the multiple pointers pattern by using two indexes (`left` and `right`) to traverse the sorted array
and find all pairs that sum to the given target efficiently without nested loops[1][3][11].

In summary, the **Multiple Pointers Pattern** is useful for problems involving pairs, sums, or other relationship checks
within sorted data where simultaneous traversal reduces computational complexity.
