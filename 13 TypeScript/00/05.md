Project references in TypeScript are a way to structure large TypeScript codebases by splitting them into smaller,
interconnected projects, each with its own `tsconfig.json`. Introduced in TypeScript 3.0, project references improve build
times, enforce logical separation between components, and help organize code more effectively[1][5].

### Key features of project references:

- **Modularization:** You can break a large project into smaller subprojects (e.g., libraries or modules) which reference
  each other explicitly.
- **`references` property:** In a `tsconfig.json`, the `references` array lists other projects (by path) that the current
  project depends on.
- **Build ordering:** TypeScript understands the dependency graph and builds projects in the correct order.
- **Output reuse:** When importing from a referenced project, TypeScript uses the compiled `.d.ts` declaration files instead
  of the source code, improving build speed and encapsulation.
- **`composite` flag:** Referenced projects must enable `"composite": true` in their `tsconfig.json`, which ensures
  declaration files are generated and enables incremental builds.
- **`--build` mode:** The `tsc --build` flag works with project references to enable faster incremental compilation by only
  rebuilding projects that have changed[1][3][5][6].

### Example scenario:

Imagine a monorepo with two projects, `lib` and `app`. The `app` project references `lib` in its `tsconfig.json`:

```json
// lib/tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}

// app/tsconfig.json
{
  "references": [
    { "path": "../lib" }
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

This setup allows `app` to import from `lib` as if it were an external package, but with the benefits of fast incremental
builds and type safety[1][6].

### Benefits:

- Improved build performance in large codebases or monorepos.
- Enforced boundaries between projects, preventing accidental cross-imports.
- Better editor support with accurate type information and navigation.
- Simplifies managing dependencies between TypeScript projects[2][3][4].

In summary, TypeScript project references enable scalable, maintainable, and efficient development by explicitly linking
smaller TypeScript projects together with well-defined dependencies and build processes.
