Hash tables are very useful in React and Node apps primarily for fast data lookup and efficient key-value storage. They are
typically used in scenarios where quick access to data by unique keys is required. Here are some common use cases and where
you might use hash tables in such apps:

1. **Caching Data**: In a Node backend or a React frontend, hash tables (or JavaScript objects/Maps that act as hash tables)
   can cache frequently accessed data for fast retrieval without repeated costly operations like database queries or API
   calls.

2. **Storing Unique Identifiers**: If your app demands quick validation or lookup by unique keys (e.g., user IDs, session
   tokens), hash tables enable constant time $$O(1)$$ access to those values.

3. **Counting and Grouping Items**: Hash tables are effective for counting occurrences (e.g., how many times a word appears
   in text) or grouping items by keys (like grouping React component states by category).

4. **Implementing Lookup Tables**: To map keys to values directly (e.g., map country codes to country names), hash tables
   provide a neat and performant approach.

5. **React State Management**: When managing complex state objects in React that need frequent updates or lookups by key,
   using hash tables can optimize rendering efficiency.

JavaScript does not have a native "hash table" type, but `Map` and `Object` are usually used as hash tables due to their
key-value capabilities. For example, `Map` allows any type of key and preserves insertion order, making it very flexible in
both Node and React contexts.

To illustrate, in Node.js you might use a hash table to cache user sessions or config data for quick access. In React, it
might be used in component state to map identifiers to UI details.

In summary, hash tables are ideal for:

- **Fast lookups by keys**
- **Data caching**
- **Unique key storage**
- **Counting or grouping operations**
- **Efficient state or data management in React**

They can be implemented directly using JavaScript's `Map` or `Object`, or via custom classes if you require specialized
hashing logic.

This approach enhances performance for data-intensive operations both on the server-side (Node.js) and client-side (React)
applications[1][2][5][8].

Here are TypeScript examples showing hash table usage with both `Map` and plain `Object`:

**Using Map in TypeScript:**

```typescript
// Create a Map with key type string and value type number
const mapTable = new Map();

// Insert key-value pairs
mapTable.set("apple", 5);
mapTable.set("banana", 8);

// Retrieve a value by key
console.log(mapTable.get("apple")); // Output: 5

// Check if a key exists
console.log(mapTable.has("banana")); // Output: true

// Delete a key-value pair
mapTable.delete("banana");
console.log(mapTable.has("banana")); // Output: false
```

**Using Object as a hash table in TypeScript:**

```typescript
// Define a type for the object keys and values
interface HashObject {
  [key: string]: number;
}

const objTable: HashObject = {};

// Insert key-value pairs
objTable["apple"] = 5;
objTable["banana"] = 8;

// Retrieve a value by key
console.log(objTable["apple"]); // Output: 5

// Check if a key exists
console.log("banana" in objTable); // Output: true

// Delete a key-value pair
delete objTable["banana"];
console.log("banana" in objTable); // Output: false
```

These examples illustrate how you can use the built-in `Map` for flexible keys and ordered entries, or a plain JavaScript
object with string keys as a simple hash table. `Map` also provides useful methods like `has` and `delete`, and can take keys
of any type, whereas plain objects have string-based keys only.

If you want a fuller implementation of a hash table using `Map` internally with a hash function, you can create a class, but
these simple examples show common usage in TypeScript applications for fast key-value storage and retrieval[1][4].
