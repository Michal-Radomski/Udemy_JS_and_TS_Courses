**Big O notation** is a mathematical and computer science concept used to describe the _asymptotic behavior_ or _growth rate_
of functions, especially to analyze the complexity of algorithms as the input size grows large[1][2][5].

More specifically:

- In **computer science**, Big O notation classifies algorithms according to how their _run time_ or _space requirements_
  increase relative to input size $$n$$. It gives an _upper bound_ on the number of operations or memory used, providing a
  way to express efficiency without concern for machine-dependent constants or smaller terms[1][2][7].

- Formally, we say a function $$f(n)$$ is $$O(g(n))$$ if there exist constants $$c > 0$$ and $$n_0 \geq 0$$ such that for all
  $$n > n_0$$, $$|f(n)| \leq c|g(n)|$$. This means $$f(n)$$ grows no faster than a constant multiple of $$g(n)$$ for large
  $$n$$[5][7].

- The letter **O** stands for “order” as in the _order_ of growth[1][2]. Big O captures the dominant term that affects
  growth, ignoring constants and less significant terms (e.g., $$4n^2 - 2n + 2$$ is $$O(n^2)$$)[1][5].

- Big O is used practically to compare algorithms—for example, an algorithm running in $$O(n)$$ time is linear, whereas one
  running in $$O(n^2)$$ time grows quadratically and is slower as input size increases. This helps in selecting algorithms
  that scale better with large data[3][4][6].

In summary, **Big O notation is a formal way to express and compare how fast functions or algorithms grow with respect to
input size, helping to measure their efficiency and scalability**[1][2][7].
