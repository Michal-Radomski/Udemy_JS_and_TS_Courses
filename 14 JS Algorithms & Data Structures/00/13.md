A greedy algorithm is a problem-solving method that makes the best choice available at each step, without considering the
bigger picture or future consequences. It picks the locally optimal solution at every stage in hopes of finding a globally
optimal solution overall. Once a decision is made, it is never reconsidered or changed later. This approach is efficient and
simple, but it does not always guarantee the best overall solution for every problem. It works best when the problem has two
properties: the greedy choice property (where making local optimal choices leads to a global optimum) and optimal
substructure (where an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of subproblems).[1][2][3][5]

For example, in the coin change problem, a greedy algorithm would always choose the largest coin value first, adding it to
the solution until the total amount is reached or exceeded. This approach is straightforward but might not always produce the
minimum number of coins if the coin denominations are unusual.[2]

Greedy algorithms are widely used in various optimization problems like Dijkstra’s shortest path, Kruskal’s minimum spanning
tree, and Huffman coding, where they do deliver optimal or near-optimal solutions quickly.[5]

In summary, a greedy algorithm solves problems by iteratively making the most immediately beneficial choice, aiming for
efficiency and simplicity, but with no assurance of the global best solution unless the problem meets specific mathematical
criteria.[3][1][2][5]
