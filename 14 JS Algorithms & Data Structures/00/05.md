The **Divide and Conquer Pattern** is an algorithm design paradigm that solves a problem by recursively **dividing** it into
smaller independent subproblems, **conquering** each subproblem by solving it (often recursively), and then **combining** the
solutions of the subproblems to form the solution to the original problem[1][2][5].

### Key steps:

1. **Divide:** Break the main problem into smaller subproblems of the same type.
2. **Conquer:** Solve each subproblem independently; if the subproblem is small enough, solve it directly as a base case.
3. **Combine:** Merge the answers of the subproblems to get the final solution.

This approach is particularly useful when the subproblems are independent and non-overlapping. It often leads to recursive
algorithms with efficient time complexity, for example, sorting algorithms like **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort** rely on
this pattern[1][2][5][6].

### Example in TypeScript: Merge Sort (classic divide and conquer)

```typescript
function mergeSort(arr: number[]): number[] {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr; // Base case: array of length 0 or 1 is sorted

  // Divide: split array into two halves
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = arr.slice(0, mid);
  const right = arr.slice(mid);

  // Conquer: recursively sort both halves
  const sortedLeft = mergeSort(left);
  const sortedRight = mergeSort(right);

  // Combine: merge two sorted halves
  return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
}

function merge(left: number[], right: number[]): number[] {
  const result: number[] = [];
  let i = 0,
    j = 0;

  while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
    if (left[i] <= right[j]) {
      result.push(left[i]);
      i++;
    } else {
      result.push(right[j]);
      j++;
    }
  }

  // Append remaining elements
  return result.concat(left.slice(i)).concat(right.slice(j));
}

// Example usage:
const array = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10];
console.log(mergeSort(array));
// Output: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
```

### Summary:

- Divide and conquer algorithms break a problem into smaller subproblems recursively.
- Base cases handle smallest subproblems directly.
- Solutions to subproblems are merged to solve the original problem.
- This pattern underlies many efficient algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)[1][2][5].
