The main differences between `any`, `unknown`, and `never` in TypeScript are as follows:

## `any`

- Represents any type and disables type checking for that variable.
- You can assign any value to a variable of type `any` and perform any operation on it without compile-time errors.
- It is the most permissive type and effectively opts out of type safety.
- Using `any` can lead to runtime errors because it bypasses TypeScript's type system[2][8].

## `unknown`

- Represents a value of unknown type.
- Safer than `any` because you cannot perform operations on an `unknown` value without first narrowing its type (e.g., using
  type guards).
- Forces you to explicitly check or assert the type before using the value, making code more robust and type-safe.
- Useful when dealing with data from external sources like APIs where the shape of the data is not known upfront.
- Acts as a "top type" in type theory, meaning it can hold any value but cannot be used directly without type
  checking[1][5][6][8].

## `never`

- Represents a type that never occurs; it is the "bottom type."
- Used to indicate values or code paths that are impossible to reach, such as functions that always throw an error or
  infinite loops.
- Cannot be assigned any value except another `never`.
- Useful for exhaustive checks in switch statements to ensure all cases are handled.
- In union types, `never` is automatically removed since it adds no possible values[1][5][6][7].

### Summary Table

| Type      | Meaning                        | Usage Example                                                 | Type Safety                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `any`     | Any value, disables checks     | `let x: any = 5; x.foo();`                                    | No type safety (unsafe)                |
| `unknown` | Any value, but must be checked | `let x: unknown = 5; if (typeof x === 'number') x.toFixed();` | Type safe, requires checks             |
| `never`   | No value, impossible type      | `function fail(): never { throw new Error(); }`               | Type safe, represents unreachable code |

In essence, use `any` to opt out of type checking, `unknown` to represent uncertain types safely, and `never` to represent
impossible or unreachable code paths in your TypeScript programs[1][2][5][6][8].
