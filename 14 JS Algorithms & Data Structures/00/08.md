The **static** keyword in JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS) defines properties or methods that belong to the class itself
rather than to any instance (object) created from that class. This means static members are accessed directly on the class,
not on instances of the class.

Key points about the **static** keyword:

- **Static methods and properties belong to the class**: They are not part of the individual objects created from the class.
- **Access**: You access static members using the class name, e.g., `ClassName.staticMethod()` or `ClassName.staticProperty`,
  instead of through an instance like `instance.staticMethod()`.
- **Use cases**: Static methods often serve as utility functions that don't rely on instance data, such as mathematical
  operations. Static properties might hold constants or values shared across all instances, such as counters or configuration
  settings.
- **Instance methods and properties** belong to individual objects and usually operate on instance-specific data.

Example in JavaScript:

```js
class MathUtil {
  static PI = 3.14159;

  static getDiameter(radius) {
    return radius * 2;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtil.PI); // 3.14159
console.log(MathUtil.getDiameter(10)); // 20
```

In this example, `PI` and `getDiameter` are static; you call them on the class directly, not on an instance.

In TypeScript, static works the same way, often used to create shared constants or utility methods.

Also important:

- Static members cannot be accessed from instances.
- Static members are useful for data or behavior common to all instances or unrelated to instance-specific data.

In summary, **static** defines class-level properties or methods accessible without instantiating the class, allowing shared
or utility functionality[1][2][3][4][5][8].

If you want, I can provide code examples or further explanation on static members in either JavaScript or TypeScript.
