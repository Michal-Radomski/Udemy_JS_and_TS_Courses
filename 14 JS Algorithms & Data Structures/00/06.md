**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function **calls itself** in order to solve a problem by breaking it down
into smaller, simpler instances of the same problem. It typically involves:

- A **base case** that stops the recursion to prevent infinite calls.
- One or more **recursive cases** where the function calls itself with simpler or smaller inputs.

This approach is powerful for problems that can naturally be divided into similar subproblems, such as mathematical
sequences, tree traversals, or divide-and-conquer algorithms[1][3][5].

### How recursion works:

1. The function checks if the problem is simple enough (base case).
2. If not, it solves a smaller part of the problem by calling itself (recursive call).
3. Combines the result of the smaller problem(s) to solve the original problem.

### Example: Factorial function in TypeScript

```typescript
function factorial(n: number): number {
  if (n === 0) return 1; // Base case
  return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

In this example, `factorial(n)` calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches zero, then calculates the factorial by multiplying
back up[1][3][5].

### Key points about recursion:

- Every recursive function must have a base case.
- Recursive calls should progress toward the base case.
- It can lead to elegant solutions but might cause stack overflow if recursion depth is too large.
- Often used in algorithms for tree traversal, combinatorics, dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer[1][6][8].

### Types of recursion:

- **Single recursion:** Function calls itself once per activation.
- **Multiple recursion:** Function calls itself multiple times (like Fibonacci).
- **Tail recursion:** Recursive call is the last operation in the function, enabling optimization in some languages[1][6].

Recursion is a fundamental concept underpinning many algorithmic patterns, including divide and conquer and backtracking.
