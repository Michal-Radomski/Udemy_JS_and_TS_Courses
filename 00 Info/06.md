`void 0` in JavaScript is an expression that evaluates to `undefined`. The `void` operator takes any expression, evaluates
it, and then returns `undefined` regardless of the original expression's value. Writing `void 0` means "evaluate 0 (which
does nothing) and return `undefined`" â€” effectively a guaranteed way to get the primitive `undefined` value[1][2][4][5].

Historically, `void 0` was used as a safer alternative to the global `undefined` variable because before ES5, `undefined`
could be overwritten or redefined, causing bugs. Since `void 0` always returns the true `undefined` value, it was used to
avoid such issues. However, in modern JavaScript engines (ES5 and later), the global `undefined` property is read-only, so
this is no longer necessary[5].

In practice, you often see `void 0` in contexts like:

```html
Click me
```

This prevents the link from navigating or reloading the page because the expression returns `undefined`, which does not
trigger navigation. It is a way to create a link that does nothing by default but can have JavaScript event handlers
attached[1][2][6][7].

### Summary:

- `void 0` evaluates to `undefined`.
- It was historically used to avoid issues with redefined `undefined`.
- Now mostly a legacy pattern; using plain `undefined` is fine in modern code.
- Commonly used in links like `href="javascript:void(0)"` to prevent default navigation behavior.

This makes `void 0` a concise and guaranteed way to get `undefined` in JavaScript.
