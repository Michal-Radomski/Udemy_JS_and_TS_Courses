**Space complexity** in Big O notation measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of its input.
It includes both the memory needed for the inputs themselves and any additional memory used during computation, called
auxiliary space.

Expressed as $$O(f(n))$$, space complexity describes the upper bound on how the memory requirement grows as the input size
$$n$$ increases. For example:

- $$O(1)$$ indicates constant space usage regardless of input size.
- $$O(n)$$ indicates memory usage grows linearly with input size.
- More complex cases can be $$O(n \log n)$$, $$O(n^2)$$, etc.

Space complexity is determined by analyzing the variables, data structures, and function call stacks (in recursion) used in
an algorithm. It is evaluated in a similar way to time complexity but focuses on memory instead of execution
time.[1][2][5][6]

To summarize: **Space complexity in Big O notation quantifies how the memory requirement of an algorithm scales with input
size, and is expressed as an upper bound $$O(f(n))$$, helping compare and understand the memory efficiency of algorithms**.
