The **Sliding Window Pattern** is an algorithmic technique mainly used to solve problems involving **contiguous subarrays or
substrings** efficiently. Instead of using nested loops that lead to quadratic time complexity $$O(n^2)$$, sliding window
helps reduce the complexity to linear time $$O(n)$$.

### Concept:

- Think of a **window** (a subset) that slides over the array or string.
- The window can be of fixed or variable size, depending on the problem.
- As the window slides, it **adds** the next element on one end and **removes** the element on the other end to update the
  current state efficiently.
- This avoids recomputing the entire sum or condition for every new window position.

### Use cases:

- Maximum/minimum sum of subarrays of size $$k$$.
- Longest substring with certain properties (e.g., no repeating characters).
- Finding substrings or subarrays meeting specific conditions efficiently.

### Example in TypeScript: Maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`

```typescript
function maxSumSubarray(arr: number[], k: number): number {
  let maxSum = 0;
  let windowSum = 0;

  // Calculate the sum of the first window of size k
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    windowSum += arr[i];
  }
  maxSum = windowSum;

  // Slide the window from k to end of array
  for (let end = k; end < arr.length; end++) {
    windowSum += arr[end] - arr[end - k]; // Add next element and remove leftmost element
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }

  return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
const numbers = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2];
const k = 3;
console.log(maxSumSubarray(numbers, k)); // Output: 9 (sum of subarray [5,1,3])
```

This code demonstrates the sliding window approach by:

- Summing the first `k` elements initially.
- Then sliding the window one element at a time by subtracting the element that rolls out and adding the new element.
- Updating the maximum sum found during the process.

This way, the sum for each window is computed in constant time, drastically improving performance from $$O(nk)$$ to
$$O(n)$$[1][2][3][6][9].
